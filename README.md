# Survey-Form

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a survey form designed to collect valuable data from users. The form is structured with various input fields and elements, adhering to specific requirements to enhance user interaction and information gathering.

## Page Components

- **Page Title:** An `h1` element with the id of "title" provides a clear and prominent title for the survey form.

- **Description:** A brief explanation in a `p` element with the id of "description" offers context regarding the purpose of the survey.

## Form Structure

- **Form Element:** The primary container with the id "survey-form" encapsulates all the input fields and elements, providing a cohesive structure for user input.

### Input Fields

1. **Name Input Field:** An input field (id: "name") prompts users to input their name.

2. **Email Input Field:** Another input field (id: "email") requests users to input their email address, with HTML5 validation ensuring proper formatting.

3. **Number Input Field:** A numeric input field (id: "number") accepts only numerical values within a specified range. HTML5 validation prevents non-numeric input and values outside the defined range.

### Labels and Placeholders

- Corresponding labels with ids "name-label," "email-label," and "number-label" provide clarity for associated input fields.

- Placeholder text within the input fields offers descriptive guidance to users.

### Additional Input Elements

- **Dropdown Select:** A select dropdown (id: "dropdown") offers users a choice from at least two options.

- **Radio Buttons:** Users can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons, grouped using the name attribute.

- **Checkboxes:** Multiple checkboxes, each with a value attribute, allow users to select several options.

- **Textarea:** A textarea field provides space for users to add additional comments.

### Submission

- A submit button with the id "submit" facilitates the submission of all entered information.

## Purpose

The survey form is designed to be user-friendly, with HTML5 validation ensuring data accuracy. Clear labels and placeholders enhance the user experience, making the data collection process straightforward and effective.
